## 🏛️ The Institutional Context: SK-Crossroads

> "We cultivate a science that listens as much as it measures, and imagines as much as it explains, one that sees knowledge as a vivid exchange between the known and the unknown." — **A.C.**

> "This front has the purpose of being a transducer, converting all and any potential energy from the papers into the kinetic energy of the POCs. Moreover, the front’s specialty is converting the entropy of vibrant minds into high output power." — **F.T.**

This repository serves as a personal research node within the **AI Intern program at Kunumi Institute (SK-Crossroads)**. Operating as a spin-off of the Fast-Track team, we are dedicated to two core missions:

* **Keeping Up with AI:** Tracking emerging research, benchmarking libraries/frameworks, and distinguishing hype from utility through rigorous experimentation.
* **Building an AI-Driven Institute:** Transforming the organization into an AI-native entity by integrating advanced AI capabilities into our daily workflows.

## 🧭 My Proposal: Critical Speculation Space

Within this ecosystem, my work is configured as a **Critical Speculation Space**.

This repository is where the Institute's mission meets my personal thesis: the necessity of **"Objects-to-think-with"**. Here, I convert the potential energy of social and cognitive theories into the kinetic energy of AI prototypes that challenge the status quo.

> "We do not seek merely to predict the future based on past data, but to use AI to design alternative chronotopes where technology serves fairer, ethical, and plural purposes."

## 🧬 Research Axes

My contribution to SK-Crossroads is organized into five vectors, bridging hard engineering with philosophy of technology and creative experimentation:

### 1. Counterfactual Worlds & AI Hermeneutics
Investigating how to expand the conception of reading and signification (hermeneutics) in AI models, moving beyond statistical token prediction.

* **The Experiment:** Blending Causal Models (Causal Inference) with Transformer architectures.
* **The Goal:** To increase creativity and Explainability, grounded in diverse analogies of human understanding.
* **The Question:** How can we use AI to reason about *"What if?"* and generate alternative realities that enrich our view of the possible?

### 2. New Chronotopes for Meaning Making
Inspired by Mikhail Bakhtin, we investigate how AI perceives and constructs time and space.

* **The Critique:** Current AI operates in linear, compressed time, often ignoring the cyclical nature of non-Western cultures.
* **The Goal:** To create **"Algorhythms"** — technologies anchored in alternative cultural matrices, where time is relational and space is one of care and reciprocity.
* **The Practice:** Cultural Analytics to map and correct temporal biases in large datasets.

### 3. Socio-Cognitive Agents (Beyond Behaviorism)
Questioning the hegemony of Behaviorism (stimulus-response) implicit in most Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems.

* **The Action:** Building Agent Models based on Socio-Cognitive theories (Vygotsky).
* **The Shift:** Moving from training focused solely on individual reward maximization to agents that learn through social interaction, mediation, and Zones of Proximal Development (ZPD).
* **The Stack:** Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), Social Simulation Environments.

### 4. Technological Mediation & Ethical AI Design
Centering Indigenous Protocols and Artificial Intelligence to amplify historically silenced voices and perspectives.

* **The Context:** Challenging hegemonic narratives by prioritizing Sovereignty and Self-Determination over data (UNDRIP).
* **The Ethics:** Shifting from extractive logic to Reciprocity and Care, viewing technologies as relations that demand mutual responsibility.
* **The Vision:** Digital Decolonization and Epistemic Diversity—moving from standard Algorithms to *Algorhythms*, recognizing a pluriverse of valid knowledge systems.

### 5. Anthropophagic AI & Post-Sampling Aesthetics
A laboratory for creative experimentation inspired by the Brazilian Modernist concept of *Antropofagia* (Oswald de Andrade) and contemporary remix culture.

* **The Concept:** "Devouring" global, hegemonic AI models to digest them and produce something uniquely local, critical, and sovereign.
* **The Practice:** Exploring Post-Sampling techniques—treating generative AI outputs not as final products, but as raw material for sampling, glitching, and re-signifying.
* **The Goal:** To reclaim agency over the "black box" through artistic misuse and poetic engineering.
